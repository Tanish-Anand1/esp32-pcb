## 10/6/2025 - I have created a ESP32 custom gamepad PCB  

Creating a custom ESP32-based gamepad PCB combines hardware design and embedded programming to deliver a versatile and wireless controller solution. The ESP32 microcontroller was chosen for its dual-core processor, integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, and ample GPIO pins, making it ideal for HID (Human Interface Device) applications like gamepads.

The custom PCB is designed to accommodate a range of inputs including push buttons (for D-pad and action buttons), analog joysticks (via ADC pins), shoulder buttons, and possibly additional inputs like rotary encoders or touchpads. Button inputs are routed through pull-down resistors and debounced either in hardware or software to ensure clean signals. For analog inputs, the ESP32’s ADCs read joystick positions, which are then scaled and calibrated within the firmware.

Power management is handled via a Li-ion battery circuit with onboard charging using a TP4056 module or similar. Voltage regulation ensures stable 3.3V operation for the ESP32 and peripherals. The PCB includes a USB-C port for charging and possibly for wired HID support.

Firmware is developed using the Arduino IDE or ESP-IDF, leveraging libraries like *NimBLE* for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or *ESP32-BLE-Gamepad* to emulate a standard gamepad on PC or mobile devices. The firmware scans inputs, maps them to HID reports, and transmits data over BLE or USB.

This custom ESP32 gamepad offers a cost-effective, wireless controller option, suitable for DIY gaming setups, emulators, or custom robotics control, with expandability for future input or output features.

## 10/30/2025 12:17 AM - I am think To add a option to play it on a big screen  

The Play on Big Screen option allows users to seamlessly stream or mirror their app or website experience onto a larger display such as a smart TV, projector, or external monitor. This feature enhances visibility and engagement, making it ideal for presentations, group activities, or immersive viewing. Users can connect via wireless options like Chromecast, Miracast, or AirPlay, or through HDMI for wired setups.![Retro-Game-Console-PCB-3D-Design](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjUxNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c8f4d692fe587d44d79b7f233c8014c121aef4ef/Retro-Game-Console-PCB-3D-Design.jpg)
  

## 10/30/2025 12:19 AM - It will be comming with adaptive triggers  

The Play on Big Screen feature will allow users to enjoy their experience on larger displays like TVs or projectors for enhanced immersion. It will be coming with adaptive triggers, providing dynamic resistance and tactile feedback that respond to user actions — making interactions feel more realistic and engaging.![Retro-Game-Console-PCB-3D-Design](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjUxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d556f657ef3f417c4e6e1462d060dcbcd7310833/Retro-Game-Console-PCB-3D-Design.jpg)

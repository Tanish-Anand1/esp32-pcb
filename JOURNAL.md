## 10/6/2025 - I have created a ESP32 custom gamepad PCB  

Creating a custom ESP32-based gamepad PCB combines hardware design and embedded programming to deliver a versatile and wireless controller solution. The ESP32 microcontroller was chosen for its dual-core processor, integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, and ample GPIO pins, making it ideal for HID (Human Interface Device) applications like gamepads.

The custom PCB is designed to accommodate a range of inputs including push buttons (for D-pad and action buttons), analog joysticks (via ADC pins), shoulder buttons, and possibly additional inputs like rotary encoders or touchpads. Button inputs are routed through pull-down resistors and debounced either in hardware or software to ensure clean signals. For analog inputs, the ESP32â€™s ADCs read joystick positions, which are then scaled and calibrated within the firmware.

Power management is handled via a Li-ion battery circuit with onboard charging using a TP4056 module or similar. Voltage regulation ensures stable 3.3V operation for the ESP32 and peripherals. The PCB includes a USB-C port for charging and possibly for wired HID support.

Firmware is developed using the Arduino IDE or ESP-IDF, leveraging libraries like *NimBLE* for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or *ESP32-BLE-Gamepad* to emulate a standard gamepad on PC or mobile devices. The firmware scans inputs, maps them to HID reports, and transmits data over BLE or USB.

This custom ESP32 gamepad offers a cost-effective, wireless controller option, suitable for DIY gaming setups, emulators, or custom robotics control, with expandability for future input or output features.
